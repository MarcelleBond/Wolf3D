# Wolf3D

This project aims to strengthen your skills in graphic design by implementing basic algorithms and mathematics to create elegant and efficient algorithms. It is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.

The project objectives include rigor, the use of C, basic algorithms, information research, data mining, windows, colors, events, and fill shapes. With the help of numerous documents available on the internet, you will use mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.

Wolf3D is an excellent opportunity to solidify your skills in the graphic design area. John Carmack is undoubtedly a genius, and he was one of the first programmers to think about these applications, and remains famous for them today.

## Usage

To compile the project, use the included Makefile. Run the following command in your terminal:

make

This will compile the project and create the executable file.
